<p>TLDR this is the recap of my two Meridian talks. #Meridian2024 was
actually the first Meridian I could attend, but the wait for meeting irl
the folks I worked with for the last years was worth it.</p>
<p>I’ll be expanding more on both the talks, likely mainly about the
state of decentralization panel, but here’s a quick summary of the
follwing talks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D115eOIJWXE">Reusing the
Soroban VM and Toolchain for Off-Chain Applications</a></li>
<li><a

Takes an Ecosystem: The State of Decentralization on Stellar</a></li>

<h1
id="reusing-the-soroban-vm-and-toolchain-for-off-chain-applications">Reusing
the Soroban VM and Toolchain for Off-Chain Applications</h1>
<p>This was my first Meridian talk ever. Luckily the topics I talk about
are the ones I work with every day so that might have alleviated the
stress. At its core, the talk revolved around showcasing how great the
virtual machine powering Stellar smart contracts is.</p>
<p>I talk about three main use cases and applications that can be
powered thanks to the VMs design:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Low hanging fruits: exploring the high level svm API.</li>
<li>Runtime tooling through VM forks.</li>
<li>Using the SVM’s host-isolation capabilities to reuse soroban
functionality within other VMs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="svm-high-level-api.">SVM High Level API.</h2>
<p>Here I suggest that any developer building on Soroban try out the
high-level API of the soroban VM by pulling in the host environemnt’s
code and playing around with the execution inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>More specifically, I talk about how xBull uses this API to power its
balance changes functionality which can give users more trust before
signing transactions (note that it is <strong>not</strong> a bulletproof
way of avoiding scams).</p>
<h2 id="runtime-tooling.">Runtime tooling.</h2>
<p>This is the beginning of the advanced topics in the talk. I showcase
that by forking the Soroban virtual machine and adding functionality to
the runtime you can achieve incredible tooling such as <a
href="https://www.mercurydata.app/products/retroshades">Retroshades</a>.</p>
<p>This happens by pairing the custom runtime along with parallel
real-time transaction replay functionality.</p>
<h2 id="reusing-the-svms-host.">Reusing the SVM’s host.</h2>
<p>The was the original main point of the talk and aims to showcase how
composable the SVM’s architecture is. The design allows to easily
distinguish between the host functionality and the virtual machine,
enabling developers to import the host funcitonality without the VM
inside their own VMs and also enabling them to re-use the SDK by
tampering with the module’s instantiation process, mainly with the
linker, to add all soroban host functions as standard VM functions.</p>
<p>The only functions that do require some additional manual work are
those which depend on reading from webassembly’s linear memory since by
default the host environment is bound to use the crate’s inner
<code>VmCaller</code> object. I talk a bit more about this in the <a
href="https://heytdep.github.io/post/21/post.html">talk’s technical
references</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Following the talk, the below points should be clear: 1. The SVM is
really well developed, among the very best blockchain VMs (not only for
the reasons listed in the talk). 2. If you’re an audacious developer,
trying to work along with the VM might be a good idea. 3. It’s even a
better idea to rely on the low-level tooling that I built around the
idea of this talk. You can learn more about it on <a

<h1 id="state-of-decentralization-panel">State of Decentralization
Panel</h1>
<p>This wasn’t technically a talk, rather a discussion along with Justin
(SDF), Anke (SDF) and Alex (Script3) about the past, present and future
about stellar decentralization. There are so many points in this panel
which I wouldn’t be able to fit into one article, let alone in a recap
but my arguments were mainly that: 1. SCP has a very different consensus
than PoS or PoW, it’s based on configurable agreements and trust
intersections that make it viable and safe also in the case that only a
few organizations are in the tier 1 quorum. 2. Soroban will highly boost
community participation from big players and developers in the ecosystem
that are not SDF to contribute to standards, core improvements, running
nodes, and other governance related aspects. Consensus is not the only
topic when talking about decentralization!</p>
<p>As I hinted in the beginning of this article, I plan to publish more
here about the state of decentralization and improvement proposals, so
this is just the beginning.</p>
