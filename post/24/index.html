<p>TLDR I just opened a core PR to add opt-in reentrancy to Soroban.
Calling all developers to discuss this!</p>
<h1 id="back-story-and-proposal">Back Story and Proposal</h1>
<p>I kind of always gave for granted that Soroban would have always had
reentrancy disabled. I thought, it’s better for security. And it is. I
built xycLoans, Soroban’s very first flash loans protocol with this in
mind and with approval-based flash loans. I never questioned having to
add reentrancy before this morning after seeing this comment on the
Stellar developers discord server:</p>

<p>Previously this week, I’ve also been digging a bit into some other
blockchain VMs code, including Arbitrum’s multiVM, or better Arbitrum’s
stylus SDK since their VM is heavily memory based, and they also do have
opt-in reentrancy. These inputs were enough for me to pursue a fairly
low hanging fruit in my free time this afternoon. In fact, I already
knew where to look and how to go about implementing this. Ironically,
crafting the tests took longer than the actual change!</p>
<p>The proposal’s core is to add two new host functions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>call_reentrant</code></li>
<li><code>try_call_reentrant</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Both with the same signatures as <code>call</code> and
<code>try_call</code>. You can learn more about my reasoning behind this
design <a href="https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/pull/1491">on
the PR itself</a>, but the main points are that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this makes the change backwards compatible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>this way it is trivial to discover which contracts do use reentrant
function calls (because the module imports the reentrant calls, this is
hardcoded in the binary and not runtime-derived), instructing developers
calling them to be extra careful with including them in their contract’s
logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>adding other host functions is not an efficiency burden thanks to the
newly added streamlined linking.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="why-and-join-the-discussion">Why and Join the Discussion!</h1>
<p>There a few reasons why we’d want opt-in reentrancy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some DeFi fundamentals are simply better off with reentrancy.</li>
<li>Easier for EVM devs that are used to working with reentrancy to
adapt and potentially port their codebases.</li>
<li>Makes the life of solidity &gt; soroban wasm compilers like solang
much easier when it comes to porting existing evm contracts.</li>
<li>Opt-in with proper safety and discoverability about the risks is a
win-win in my opinion.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I’d love for other developers and people in the community to
share their thoughts on either the implementation or the motivation. <a

talked about this before</a>, if community developers (and also the
broader community) get more involved with the network’s fundamentals
that aligns the development in the right direction.</p>
