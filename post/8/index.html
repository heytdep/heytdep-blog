<h2 class="unnumbered" id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>The Paulette, was a law enforced by France in the beginning of the
17th century. It allowed the king to sell the ownership of public
offices (making them hereditary). The owners of these public offices had
to pay a tax each <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>t</em></span>
to keep a bought public office. These offices expire every <span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>t</em></span> and the owner of each
office has to pay a tax to maintain the ownership, if they didn’t pay
this tax, the office could be revoked by the king.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="actual-implementation-abstract">Actual
implementation Abstract</h1>
<p>The contract admin can create new offices and put them for sale by
invoking the <a
href="https://github.com/Xycloo/soroban-dutch-auction-contract">Soroban
Dutch Auction Contract</a>. This means that these offices start with a
certain price which decreases with time. Users can then buy these
offices at the auction’s price and become the owners. The offices expire
after a week ( <span class="math inline">604800<em>s</em></span> ), and
can be renewed by paying a tax (ideally less than the price at which the
office was bought). If more than a week goes by and the owner hasn’t
paid the tax yet, the admin can revoke the office and put it for sale in
an auction again.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="what-youll-learn">What You’ll Learn</h1>
<p>This contract is quite complete in terms of used functionalities, by
looking at the code and following this post you’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>how Soroban’s contract data storage works for inserting, getting
and deleting data.</p></li>
<li><p>how to call a contract from within another contract by calling an
external contract for the auction (and one for the standard token
implementation).</p></li>
<li><p>how to use your custom types for more explicitness in your code
(in this contract only the <code>TimeStamp</code> type for simplicity,
but on a production-level contract you may have to explicit most of the
types that can become ambiguous to a future maintainer).</p></li>
<li><p>using the standard token implementation to transfer
tokens.</p></li>
<li><p>manage and test the auth process for an administrator.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This contract is also well documented even though it’s an unusual
situation (a protocol has some kind of public offices that hold a
certain value and the owners have to pay periodically to keep the
office). Anyways, while reading this article it’s a good idea to also
refer to the comments (or docs) in the shown code fragments.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="writing-the-contract">Writing the
Contract</h1>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>Before starting to write the contract, you’ll have to set up a Rust
crate and add some configs to the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>cargo new --lib soroban-paulette-smart-contract</code></pre>
<p>You also have to change your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and have it
look like the following (where we are simply specifying some things
about our library and adding the soroban sdk with its auth helpers to
the crate):</p>
<pre><code>[package]
name = &quot;soroban-paulette-smart-contract&quot;
version = &quot;0.0.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;
publish = false

[lib]
crate-type = [&quot;cdylib&quot;, &quot;rlib&quot;]

[features]
testutils = [&quot;soroban-sdk/testutils&quot;, &quot;soroban-auth/testutils&quot;]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
soroban-auth = &quot;0.1.0&quot;

[dev_dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;, features = [&quot;testutils&quot;] }
soroban-auth = { version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;, features = [&quot;testutils&quot;] }
rand = { version = &quot;0.7.3&quot; }</code></pre>
<p>You can also go ahead and create the <code>test.rs</code> and
<code>testutils.rs</code> files for when we’ll have to write our unit
tests.</p>
<p>You’re now all set and can start building the contract!</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="importing-contracts">Importing Contracts</h1>
<p>As previously hinted we are going to import two contracts: the
standard token contract and the dutch auction contract. To do so, you’ll
first have to build (or download) the two WASM binaries of the contracts
(which you can find in the repo), and then use the
<code>contractimport!</code> macro:</p>
<pre><code>mod token {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(file = &quot;./soroban_token_spec.wasm&quot;);
}

mod auction {
    use crate::{Identifier, Signature};
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(file = &quot;./soroban_dutch_auction_contract.wasm&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>Over the next paragraphs, I’ll dive into calling these two contracts
from our "paulette" contract.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="data-keys-and-custom-types">Data Keys and
Custom Types</h1>
<p>Contract data works pretty much like a key-value store in Soroban,
which means that things can get messy if we don’t enforce a strong
naming system for our keys. That is why we will define the
<code>DataKey</code> enum:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
/// Keys for the contract data
pub enum DataKey {
    /// What standard token to use in the contract
    TokenId,
    /// Contract admin
    Admin,
    /// Tax to pay to keep the office after a week
    Tax,
    /// Key for offices that are for sale
    ForSale(BytesN&lt;16&gt;),
    /// Key for offices that have been bought
    Bought(BytesN&lt;16&gt;),
    /// Admin nonce
    Nonce(Identifier),
}</code></pre>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="about-custom-types">About custom types</h2>
<p>On a production-level contract, it might be better to achieve further
clarity in our code by creating new types or variants for values that
can become ambiguous for not having their own descriptive type. For
example, I have created a <code>TimeStamp</code> type for timestamps
rather than using a <code>u64</code> type directly:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Eq, Ord, Debug)]
#[contracttype]
/// Timestamp type to enforce explicitness
pub struct TimeStamp(pub u64);</code></pre>
<p>That obviously means that I also have to make some more
implementations, for example one to sum two timestamps:</p>
<pre><code>// Perform arithmetic ops on custom types
trait Arithmetic&lt;Rhs = Self&gt; {
    type Output;

    fn add(self, rhs: Rhs) -&gt; Self::Output;
}

impl Arithmetic&lt;TimeStamp&gt; for TimeStamp {
    type Output = TimeStamp;

    fn add(self, other: Self) -&gt; Self {
        Self(self.0 + other.0)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I could have also used an alias (<code>type TimeStamp = u64</code>),
but I wanted to leave room for further work on the
<code>TimeStamp</code> type (invariants, covariants, impls, etc), as a
matter of fact I have already added another implementation for this type
to get the latest ledger timestamp:</p>
<pre><code>impl TimeStamp {
    fn current(e: &amp;Env) -&gt; Self {
        Self(e.ledger().timestamp())
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Notice that I am using <code>environment.ledger().timestamp()</code>
to access the ledger’s current timestamp. Remember that in order to make
smart contracts efficient and scalable, there is not much data that
contracts are allowed to fetch. Still, things like the ledger’s
timestamp, protocol version and network passphrase can be accessed
through <code>environment.ledger()</code>.</p>
<p>I have also added an <code>Auth</code> type to wrap better the admin
auth (signature and nonce), and an office struct which will be the one
stored in the contract data for each contract the admin creates and
revokes:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
/// Auth type to wrap admin signature and nonce together
pub struct Auth {
    pub sig: Signature,
    pub nonce: BigInt,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
/// Office struct, stored with key DataKey::Bought(id)
pub struct Office {
    pub user: Identifier,
    pub expires: TimeStamp,
}</code></pre>
<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="data-helpers-writing-and-reading-contract-data">Data helpers:
writing and reading contract data</h1>
<p>To interact with contract data in soroban, we use
<code>environment.data()</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>environment.data().get(key)</code>: gets the value stored
on the contract’s data which is associated with the key
<code>key</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>environment.data().set(key, value)</code>: creates or edits
the value stored on the contract’s data which is associated with the key
<code>key</code> by setting <code>value</code> as value.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is helpful to have functions perform the action of interacting
with specific keys of the contract data:</p>
<pre><code>
fn put_bought(e: &amp;Env, id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;, bought: Office) {
    let key = DataKey::Bought(id);
    e.data().set(key, bought);
}

fn get_bought(e: &amp;Env, id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;) -&gt; Office {
    let key = DataKey::Bought(id);
    e.data().get(key).unwrap().unwrap()
}

fn remove_bought(e: &amp;Env, id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;) {
    let key = DataKey::Bought(id);
    e.data().remove(key);
}

fn remove_for_sale(e: &amp;Env, id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;) {
    let key = DataKey::ForSale(id);
    e.data().remove(key);
}

fn put_for_sale(e: &amp;Env, id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;, auction: BytesN&lt;32&gt;) {
    let key = DataKey::ForSale(id);
    e.data().set(key, auction)
}

fn get_for_sale(e: &amp;Env, id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;) -&gt; BytesN&lt;32&gt; {
    let key = DataKey::ForSale(id);
    e.data().get(key).unwrap().unwrap()
}

fn put_token_id(e: &amp;Env, token_id: BytesN&lt;32&gt;) {
    let key = DataKey::TokenId;
    e.data().set(key, token_id);
}

fn put_tax(e: &amp;Env, amount: BigInt) {
    let key = DataKey::Tax;
    e.data().set(key, amount);

fn get_tax(e: &amp;Env) -&gt; BigInt {

fn get_token_id(e: &amp;Env) -&gt; BytesN&lt;32&gt; {

<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="interacting-with-the-dutch-auction-contract">Interacting with the
dutch auction contract</h1>
<p>If you haven’t already I recommend checking the <a
href="https://github.com/Xycloo/soroban-dutch-auction-contract">soroban-dutch-auction-contract
README</a> to better understand what happens in the auctions.<br />
To create a new auction, we have to initialize an existing auction
contract (which needs to be registered to the environment). This means
that rather than deploying the auction contract directly from the
paulette contract through <code>env.deployer()</code>, we will leave the
deployment of the auction contract to another contract (or manually),
and only require the id to initialize the contract (i.e creating the
auction).</p>
<p>Before initializing the contract we need a client to interact with
it, we create one with:</p>
<pre><code>let client = auction::Client::new(e, id); // id is the provided contract id</code></pre>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="initializing-the-auction">Initializing the
auction</h2>
<p>We can then begin the auction by calling the contract’s client just
like the <a
href="https://github.com/Xycloo/soroban-dutch-auction-contract/blob/main/src/test.rs#L59">auction
contract’s tests</a>:</p>
<pre><code>fn new_auction(e: &amp;Env, id: BytesN&lt;32&gt;, price: BigInt, min_price: BigInt, slope: BigInt) {
    let client = auction::Client::new(e, id);
    client.initialize(
        &amp;read_administrator(e),
        &amp;get_token_id(e),
        &amp;price,
        &amp;min_price,
        &amp;slope,
    );
}</code></pre>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="making-a-bid">Making a bid</h2>
<p>To place a bid we just create a new client (again) and call the buy
function:</p>
<pre><code>fn bid_auction(e: &amp;Env, id: BytesN&lt;32&gt;, buyer: Identifier) -&gt; bool {
    let client = auction::Client::new(e, id);
    client.buy(&amp;buyer)
}</code></pre>
<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="interacting-with-the-token-contract">Interacting with the token
contract</h1>
<p>Since we are going to need to transfer value from the buyers to the
admin, we will need to use the standard token contract. More
specifically, we will use the <code>token_client::xfer_from()</code>
method which allows the contract to transfer a certain amount of the
token from the buyer to a certain account, assuming that the buyer has
previously allowed this transaction (using an allowance).</p>
<p>So, remembering that the <code>xfer_from</code> method looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>fn xfer_from(e: Env, spender: Signature, nonce: BigInt, from: Identifier, to: Identifier, amount: BigInt);</code></pre>
<p>We can write the following function, where
<code>&amp;read_administrator(e)</code> simply reads the ID of the
admin. We’ll dive further into working with the admin in the next
section.</p>
<pre><code>fn transfer_to_admin(e: &amp;Env, from: Identifier, amount: BigInt) {
    let client = token::Client::new(e, get_token_id(e));

    client.xfer_from(
        &amp;Signature::Invoker,
        &amp;BigInt::zero(e),
        &amp;from,
        &amp;read_administrator(e), // reads the administrator&#39;s id
        &amp;amount,
    )
}</code></pre>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="admin-management">Admin management</h1>
<p>In our contract, the admin acts pretty much like the King did (see <a
href="#inspiration">the historical inspiration</a>), meaning that they
can create and revoke offices, and receive all the fees as well.</p>
<p>Below are the functions that the code uses when interacting with the
admin:</p>
<pre><code>/// checks if the contract already has an admin
fn has_administrator(e: &amp;Env) -&gt; bool {
    let key = DataKey::Admin;
    e.data().has(key)
}

/// return the contract&#39;s admin
fn read_administrator(e: &amp;Env) -&gt; Identifier {
    let key = DataKey::Admin;
    e.data().get_unchecked(key).unwrap()
}

/// set the admin
fn write_administrator(e: &amp;Env, id: Identifier) {
    let key = DataKey::Admin;
    e.data().set(key, id);
}

/// assert that a signature is the admin&#39;s, used to authenticate the admin
fn check_admin(e: &amp;Env, auth: &amp;Signature) {
    let auth_id = auth.identifier(e);
    if auth_id != read_administrator(e) {
        panic!(&quot;not authorized by admin&quot;)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We also need some kind of cryptographic commitment proving that the
signature we are using hasn’t been used already. We do that through the
so-called <code>nonce</code>:</p>
<pre><code>fn read_nonce(e: &amp;Env, id: &amp;Identifier) -&gt; BigInt {
    let key = DataKey::Nonce(id.clone()); // remember the DataKey::Nonce
    e.data()
        .get(key)
        .unwrap_or_else(|| Ok(BigInt::zero(e)))
        .unwrap()
}

fn verify_and_consume_nonce(e: &amp;Env, auth: &amp;Signature, expected_nonce: &amp;BigInt) {
    match auth {
        Signature::Invoker =&gt; { // when signature is directly from the invoker there is no need for the nonce 
            if BigInt::zero(&amp;e) != expected_nonce {
                panic!(&quot;nonce should be zero for Invoker&quot;)
            }
            return;
        }
        _ =&gt; {}
    }

    let id = auth.identifier(&amp;e);
    let key = DataKey::Nonce(id.clone());
    let nonce = read_nonce(e, &amp;id);

    if nonce != expected_nonce {
        panic!(&quot;incorrect nonce&quot;)
    }
    e.data().set(key, &amp;nonce + 1); // increment the nonce
}
</code></pre>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="defining-our-contract-trait">Defining our
contract trait</h1>
<p>Rust traits are a great way to describe functions (as a matter of
fact a trait) that an implementation has to satisfy. We can easily use a
trait to summarize the implementations that our
<code>PauletteContract</code> should implement:</p>
<pre><code>pub trait PauletteContractTrait {
    /// Sets the admin and the Royal vault&#39;s token id
    fn initialize(e: Env, admin: Identifier, token_id: BytesN&lt;32&gt;, tax: BigInt);

    /// Returns the nonce for the admin
    fn nonce(e: Env) -&gt; BigInt;

    /// Call to buy an office
    fn buy(e: Env, id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;, buyer: Identifier);

    /// Call to pay taxes for a given office
    fn pay_tax(e: Env, id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;, payer: Identifier);

    /// Query the price of a given office
    fn get_price(e: Env, id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;) -&gt; BigInt;

    /// Create a new office (requires admin auth)
    fn new_office(
        e: Env,
        admin: Auth,
        id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;,
        auction: BytesN&lt;32&gt;,
        price: BigInt,
        min_price: BigInt,
        slope: BigInt,
    );

    /// remove office from Bought, add it to ForSale, create new dutch auction contract with the given ID
    fn revoke(
        e: Env,
        admin: Auth,
        id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;,
        auction: BytesN&lt;32&gt;,
        price: BigInt,
        min_price: BigInt,
        slope: BigInt,
    );
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that you have an overview of what the contract actually does, we
can start writing these:</p>
<pre><code>#[contractimpl]
impl PauletteContractTrait for PauletteContract {
   ...
}</code></pre>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="initialization">Initialization</h1>
<p>This step is really just about one thing: setting in the contract’s
data the params that the contract needs to start working:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the admin</p></li>
<li><p>what token to use as currency (usdc for instance)</p></li>
<li><p>how much taxes users have to pay in terms of the contract’s
currency (taxes in usdc for instance).</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>    fn initialize(e: Env, admin: Identifier, token_id: BytesN&lt;32&gt;, tax: BigInt) {
        if has_administrator(&amp;e) {
            panic!(&quot;admin is already set&quot;);
        }

        write_administrator(&amp;e, admin);
        put_token_id(&amp;e, token_id);
        put_tax(&amp;e, tax);
    }</code></pre>
<p>Remember that all these functions we are using we already have
defined, take a glance at the beginning of the article to see what they
do.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="creating-a-new-office">Creating a new
office</h1>
<p>This is slightly more complex than the initialization, in fact we
have to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>check that it’s the admin providing authorization for a new
office to be created</p></li>
<li><p>since existing offices are stored with a 16 bytes array as ID, we
need to check that the provided id doesn’t already exist.</p></li>
<li><p>create the office:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>create a new auction</p></li>
<li><p>put the office in the contract’s data with
<code>DataKey::ForSale(16_bytes_id)</code> as key and the auction’s id
as value (so that we can interact with the office’s auction without
needing to know the ID of the auction (which is the id of the auction
contract, the <code>auction</code> parameter in our case)):</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>fn new_office(
        e: Env,

    slope: BigInt,
) {
    new_auction(e, auction.clone(), price, min_price, slope);
    put_for_sale(e, id, auction);

<p>Remember that <a

talked about creating and bidding auctions</a>, and that put for sale is
a simple function (which we have already seen in the beginning of the

<code>office.expires</code> (the expiration date) is the current ledger
timestamp + 604800 (a week). "Why have such value hardcoded in the
contract rather than setting it upon initialization?", you may be
asking; there is no particular reason for this choice, I hardcoded it to
show that it is also a viable option (and sometimes mandatory). Of
course you could add another parameter in the <code>initialize</code>
method, and write a put and get function for the new enum variant
<code>DataKey::Interval</code>.</p></li>

becomes really simple:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>check that it’s the admin authorizing the action.</p></li>
<li><p>assert that the office is really expired
(<code>office.expires &lt; TimeStamp::current(&amp;e)</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>remove the <code>DataKey::Bought(id)</code> entry to replace it
with <code>DataKey::ForSale(id)</code> through the already-discussed
<code>make_new_office()</code> function:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>fn revoke(
        e: Env,
        admin: Auth,
        id: BytesN&lt;16&gt;,
        auction: BytesN&lt;32&gt;,

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="testing">Testing</h1>
<p>We have now written our contract, and need proper testing to assert
that it works as expected.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="testutils">Testutils</h2>
<p>Our testutils will act as a skeleton contract that interacts with the
actual contract but by easing some processes such as setting the
environment source account when needed (admin invocations):</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="running-tests">Running tests</h2>
<p>You can check out the tests in the <code>test.rs</code> file. The
tests are intuitive but I’d like to shine light on a couple of
things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>we are generating the auction contract externally (from the
contract) as discussed in the introduction.</p></li>
<li><p>we are setting the ledger time with:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code> e.ledger().set(LedgerInfo {
        timestamp: TIMESTAMP,
        protocol_version: 1,
        sequence_number: 10,
        network_passphrase: Default::default(),
        base_reserve: 10,
    });</code></pre>
<p>This is needed because the price of the offices changes over time
(dutch auction), and also because the offices expire over time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>we are using the <code>approve</code> method from the token
contract to allow the paulette contract to transfer the tokens out of
the buyers (if you are confused by this behaviour, read <a
href="#interacting-with-the-token-contract">this section
again</a>):</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>usdc_token.with_source_account(&amp;user2).approve(
        &amp;Signature::Invoker,
        &amp;BigInt::zero(&amp;e),
        &amp;auction_contract_id,
        &amp;paulette.get_price(office_id.clone()),
    );</code></pre>
<p>If you now run the tests, you should see them all pass:</p>
