<p>The commit-reveal scheme is a cryptographic technique which allows a
user to make a commitment to keep a certain value hidden from external
observers, only to reveal the value later in another invocation.</p>
<p>This algorithm works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>user submits the commitment in the form of
<code>sha256(user_address, value, secret)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>user calles the reveal invocation with
<code>(value, secret)</code> as parameters, which are then used along
with <code>env.invoker()</code> to re-create the inital commitment
(<code>sha256(invoker, value, secret)</code>). If the recreated
commitment and the initial commitment match, it means that
<code>value</code> is the one from the initial commitment, i.e the user
has revealed the commitment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This very simple proving scheme is very useful if the contract’s
workflow needs certain user inputs to remain hidden until a certain
event, but is also used to prevent front-running attacks (even though I
haven’t read much about if Soroban would handle front-running like
Ethereum does).</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="this-contract-a-hash-guessing-game">This
contract: a hash guessing game</h1>
<p>This contract is a simple game, where participants have to guess what
the pre-image of a certain hash is. Using the commit-reeal scheme here
protects the contract from a front-running attack, in fact let’s say
that user A finds the pre-image of the hash, and simply submits it to
the contract, user B could observe the call, submit the same solution
with a higher tx fee which will be prioritized if the number of
operations in the candidate transaction set is greater than the maximum
number of operations for the ledger.</p>
<p>By hiding the solution with the commit-reveal scheme, and revealing
it relying on with <code>env.invoker()</code>, a front-running attack
wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>The contract offers three methods.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="initializee-env-hash-bytesn32">initialize(e:
Env, hash: BytesN&lt;32&gt;)</h3>
<p>Starts the game by setting the satus, and putting the image of the
hash function:</p>
<pre><code>fn initialize(e: Env, hash: BytesN&lt;32&gt;) {
        if game_started(&amp;e) {
            panic!(&quot;game already started&quot;)
        }

        put_hash(&amp;e, hash);
        put_started(&amp;e, true);
    }</code></pre>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="commite-env-val-bytesn32">commit(e: Env, val:
BytesN&lt;32&gt;)</h3>
<p>Used to submit the initial commitment. Simply checks if the game has
started (i.e contract initialized), and then puts the commitment in the
<code>DataKey::Commit(Address)</code> data entry:</p>
<pre><code>fn commit(e: Env, val: BytesN&lt;32&gt;) {
        if !game_started(&amp;e) {
            panic!(&quot;game started yet&quot;)
        }

        store_commit(&amp;e, e.invoker(), val);
    }</code></pre>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="checke-env-guess-bytes-secret-bytes">check(e:
Env, guess: Bytes, secret: Bytes)</h3>
<p>This is where most things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The contract receives the solution and the secret used in the
initial commitment</p></li>
<li><p>re-creates the initial commitment with the two supplied params
and <code>env.invoker()</code></p></li>
<li><p>matches the re-created commitment against the initial one, if
they don’t match the contract panics</p></li>
<li><p>checks that <code>guess</code> (the solution param) is the
pre-image of the hash with <code>env.compute_hash_sha256</code></p></li>
<li><p>if everything goes right the contract sends 100 usdc (or at least
what the tests believe the usdc contract to be
(<code>[0; 32]</code>)).</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>fn check(e: Env, guess: Bytes, secret: Bytes) {

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="testing">Testing</h1>
<p>The tests should be quite straightforward if you’ve taken a look at
soroban before. The test includes three simulations where two should
panic since one attempts to front-run and the other holds a wrong
solution:</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Even if I’m not sure yet how front-running would work on soroban,
this is a gret way to get started with such proving schemes, which can
come in handy even if the contract isn’t trying to protect from
fron-running attacks.</p>
