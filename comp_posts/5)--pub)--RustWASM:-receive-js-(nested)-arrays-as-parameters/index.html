<p>Due to WASM’s memory model, passing arrays (and nested arrays) might
reveal to be quite a challenge if you’re trying to do things
securely.</p>
<p>However, we luckily have the (and ) crates that provide us a friendly
interface to work on when exchanging data. I should also mention that
whenever you are working with WebAssembly, you should always try to
avoid exchanging data between JS and your WASM binary if you are
developing with performance as one of your goals.</p>
<p>Wasm functions take and return scalar values as an . Luckily helps
with a lot of stuff, but it doesn’t do everything. Generally, we want
WASM to work with heavy computations, query and work with the data in
its own linear memory and only return small amounts of data.</p>
<p>Anyways, let’s take a look at how you can pass (or return) arrays
using the type.</p>
<h1 id="the-cargo.toml">The Cargo.toml</h1>
<p>We have to add to our dependencies (and if you don’t have it
already):</p>
<pre><code>wasm-bindgen = &quot;0.2.82&quot;
js-sys = &quot;0.3.59&quot;</code></pre>
<h1 id="receiving-arrays-as-fn-parameters">Receiving arrays as fn
parameters</h1>
<p>I have a function from my <a
href="https://github.com/heytdep/wasm-groth16-verifier">wasm-groth16-verifier</a>
crate, the function takes 9 arrays as params, so we can use the type and
infer it as type for our 9 paramaters:</p>
<pre><code>  #[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn verify_external(
    vk_a: Array,
    vk_b: Array,
    vk_g: Array,
    vk_d: Array,
    vk_g_abc: Array,
    p_a: Array,
    p_b: Array,
    p_c: Array,
    pub_f: Array,
) -&gt; bool</code></pre>
<p>Now, I know the lenght of all arrays but one, the , as you might
guess, this will be the array causing the most headache, that is because
the array will be transformed into a nested array looking like this: and
the lenght of the array can vary and the type has no implementation for
working with nested arrays, every element of the array is the same,
regarldess if it’s a string or an array. I’ve decided to manually split
the input array which will look like this into . The algorithm to do so
is simple and I’ve implemented it as follows (it might not be
optimized):</p>
<pre><code>  let mut abc_vec: Vec&lt;[String; 2]&gt; = Vec::new();
  let mut iters = 0;
  let mut i = 1;
  for _ in 0..vk_g_abc.length() {
    if i != 2 {
      i += 1;
    } else {
      if iters &gt; 0 {
        iters += 1;
        abc_vec.push([
          vk_g_abc.get(iters + (iters - 2)).as_string().unwrap(),
          vk_g_abc.get(iters + (iters - 2) + 1).as_string().unwrap(),
        ]);
        i = 1;
      } else {
        iters += 1;
        abc_vec.push([
          vk_g_abc.get(iters * (i - 2)).as_string().unwrap(),
          vk_g_abc.get(iters * (i - 1)).as_string().unwrap(),
        ]);
        i = 1;
      }
    }
  }</code></pre>
<p>The loop has to build a new array of two string types and push it to
the main array every two .</p>
<p>You can also see here that we get the elements of the array with .
For arrays where I already know the length and indexes of the elements
as well, I’ve simply built the nested tuples like this:</p>
<pre><code>  (
  [
    &amp;vk_b.get(0).as_string().unwrap(),
    &amp;vk_b.get(1).as_string().unwrap(),
  ],
  [
    &amp;vk_b.get(2).as_string().unwrap(),
    &amp;vk_b.get(3).as_string().unwrap(),
  ],
  ),</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we haven’t really received nested arrays, but this
shows how you can easily go from a non-nested fixed or non fixed-length
array, into a nested one.</p>
<p>You can look at the js demo of passing arrays to WASM of this
specific use-case at <a
