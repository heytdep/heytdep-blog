<p>I recently started learning Zig and as commitment to learning this
language, which seems ergonomic and pretty close to Rust in terms of
syntax, I started building a soroban SDK for it.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know it, creating a soroban smart contract
without an SDK is non trivial, verbose and requires you to build
conversions and host functions, and even then, helpers of top of those
host functions which alone are non-friendly to use.</p>
<p>In short, you would need to build an sdk for every contract.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ve never seen a soroban contract that doesn’t use an
SDK. Currently, in the soroban ecosystem there are two SDKs that allow
to build soroban smart contracts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the official rust sdk, which is and will probably always be the most
ergonomic way of writing a Soroban smart contract.</li>
<li>the assemblyscript sdk, which is maintained by Soneso (who has an
excellent track record for building Stellar sdks).</li>
</ul>
<p>And hopefully, there will also be a complete Soroban SDK for Zig
built by me.</p>
<h1 id="progress">Progress</h1>
<p>This is the first blog about the SDK, which is open source and can be
found at https://github.com/heytdep/zig-soroban-sdk/. Currently, I’ve
just finished implementing all <code>Val</code> conversions for small
values (&lt; 56 bits).</p>
<h1 id="what-ive-done">What I’ve done</h1>
<p>This blog series is designed to also help developers that want to
build an SDK for all WASM-compilation-compatible languages as a guide.
Building an sdk for Soroban is non-trivial and requires knowledge about
how the soroban environment works and how WebAssembly works too.</p>
<p>I’m going to assume that the reader knows WASM basics, and try to
explain at my best what concepts regarding the soroban environment are
needed to build the SDK.</p>
<h2 id="val-conversions"><code>Val</code> conversions</h2>
<p>If you take a look at the WAT code of a soroban smart contract,
you’ll notice that the exported functions will have all the same
parameter type: <code>i64</code>. That’s how the soroban virtual machine
is going to provide parameters in: <code>Val</code>. So, it’s clear that
every interaction with the sorboan environment (invocation parameters
and calls to host functions) are all based on <code>Val</code>. An sdk,
should be able to convert those <code>Val</code>s (effectively integers)
to a the type they represent (as I don’t think anyone would like to make
operations on a <code>Val</code> directly).</p>
<p>To know which type a <code>Val</code> represents, you need to look at
its tag, and once you’re certain that the <code>Val</code> represents
your type you can go forward and perform all the various bitwise shifts,
char matching (for symbols) and host function calls, needed to operate
on the <code>Val</code> integer as their type (for objects) or directly
cast the <code>Val</code> to the type for smaller types.</p>
<p>For example, take this simple contract function that multiplies two
<code>i32</code>s:</p>
<pre class="zig"><code>export fn multiply_i32(a_: Val, b_: Val) Val {
    @setRuntimeSafety(true);
    const a = I32.from_val(a_) catch unreachable;
    const b = I32.from_val(b_) catch unreachable;

    return a.mul(b).to_val();
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, all of the function’s arguments are <code>Val</code>
(note that <code>Val</code> <a
href="https://github.com/heytdep/zig-soroban-sdk/blob/main/src/val.zig#L14">is
a packed struct</a>), and then according to the chosen types of the
parameter we use the <code>from_val(val: Val)</code> method to cast
<code>Val</code> to a wrapper that then allows to also return a
<code>Val</code> through <code>WRAPPER.to_val()</code>.</p>
<p>In fact, the <code>multiply_i32()</code> function is translated in
WASM to have the following type:</p>
<pre class="wat"><code>(type $t0 (func (param i64 i64) (result i64)))</code></pre>
<h1 id="whats-next">What’s next</h1>
<p>Now comes the funniest part: including host functions, working with
objects, and creating wrappers that use them for stuff like doing large
integer operations, using vectors, writing storage data, requiring auth,
etc.</p>
