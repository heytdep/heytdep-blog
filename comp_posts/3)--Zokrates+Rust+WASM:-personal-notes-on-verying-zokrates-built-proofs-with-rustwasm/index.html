<p>Personal notes on writing a Rust verifier for zokrates-generated
veryifing key and proof, depending on my <code>ark-groth16</code> fork.
The fork is designed to target WebAssembly, effectively making it easily
cross-platform without issues, furthermore it leverages the amazing work
from the people at arkworks and isn’t depentent on Rust’s standard
library.</p>
<h1 id="workflow">Workflow</h1>
<p>’s function accepts three parameters: a struct, the proof and the
public inputs (these two have a familiar look).</p>
<p>The function seems to only accept the public inputs in a raw format,
while the verifying key must be prepared before through the function,
which accepts a struct, which has a familiar look (to the one built by
zokrates).</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that arkworks doesn’t seem to have implemented
the curve, probably also because it doesn’t <a

target 128bit security.</p>

<p>Firstly, one should remember to compile the code with the or .
Secondly, convert zokrates’ output from hexadecimal to decimal
numbers.</p>
