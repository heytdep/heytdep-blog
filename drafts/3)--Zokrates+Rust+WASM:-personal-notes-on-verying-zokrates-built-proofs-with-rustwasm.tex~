\section{Introduction}

Personal notes on writing a Rust verifier for zokrates-generated veryifing key and proof, depending on my \lstinline{ark-groth16} fork. The fork is designed to target WebAssembly, effectively making it easily cross-platform without issues, furthermore it leverages the amazing work from the people at arkworks and isn't depentent on Rust's standard library.
